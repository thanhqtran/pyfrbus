PyFRB/US is a Python-based simulation platform for the FRB/US model.

The PyFRB/US package depends on SuiteSparse version <= 5.13.0 and `swig` to build UMFPACK at install.
Before installing PyFRB/US, you must install SuiteSparse (`libsuitesparse-dev` on Linux,
or `suite-sparse` on MacOS) and `swig` using your package manager (probably `apt` on
Linux, or Homebrew on MacOS).
On Windows, you can install these dependencies and run PyFRB/US via the Windows Subsystem
for Linux (WSL). See the PyFRB/US User Guide for details.

The PyFRB/US package requires Python 3 and can be installed by running `pip install -e .`
or `pip3 install -e .` from the root directory of this package.
Python dependencies are listed in setup.py and should be automatically installed.

To access the PyFRB/US documentation, open docs/index.html in a web browser.

Demo programs can be found under the demos/ folder.
Demos expect the data/ folder to contain the LONGBASE.TXT dataset, which can be copied
over from the data_only_package.
